{
    /* Purpose: Allows the player to use their mouse and select cards 
     * present on the screen to be added to their card deck (size - 15).
     * Writer: Cristian Duque
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Display all selectable cards
     * 2. Display current number of cards in deck (Card Count - 0/15)
     * 3. Highlight a card when the mouse hovers over the card
     * 4. When a card is selected, the card is magnified (easier to read)
     * 5.
